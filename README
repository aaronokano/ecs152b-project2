Implemented:
  * GET requests work
  * Non-GET requests return error in form of HTTP response
  * Malformed requests return error in form of HTTP response
  * Requests larger than 65535 bytes return an error in an HTTP response
  * Requests are parsed to remove headers not present in RFC 1945
  * Program quits on accept, bind, socket, or listen errors
  * Proxy functions through netcat, telnet, or browser
  * Images are loaded (albeit, rather slowly)

Not implemented:
  * Nothing

Issues:
  * Webpages with many images will take an extremely long amount of time to
    load. Expect delays as timeouts will take a while.
  * Many pages return a 403 Forbidden error or do not redirect properly. This
    is simply not implemented in the proxy (and not required anyway)

Sources:
  * RFC 1945
